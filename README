The deptools component provides a simple source dependency tracking tool for
building source project from several distinct components.

The list of such dependencies is stored in a simple DEPENDENCIES file at the
root of the parent component.

The deptools script itself stored at the root of the component is in charge of
interpreting the list of dependencies.

The components may be hosted in different repositories and repository formats.  

For instance deptools may help solving source dependencies issues such as:

    * describing that the build of project A depends upon sources of project B
at revision X in branch B and upon file F in unique path P,
    * providing a simple command for extracting dependencies of project A, i.e.
extracting repository B under directory b and file F under filename f,
    * enforcing that the unique revision/label R of source tree A is sufficient
to uniquely identify A and all its source dependencies at the right revisions,
    * easily identifying, extracting, commiting, updating all components at
once,
    * referencing uniformly svn, git, mercurial, clearcase repositories, or
ftp, ssh, http URIs. 

The deptools project does not solve the orthogonal problems of:

    * actually building source components and dependencies,
    * installing cache of build results,
    * specifying runtime dependencies between components.

This tool is an import of an older tool called dependencies that was used for
tracking dependencies between different source code repositories.
