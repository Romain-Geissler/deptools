Deptools is a python tool with some additional shell scripts for testing.

Currently there is no installation procedure as this tool is supposed to be
embedded as part of a component that uses it.

Thus one just have to make, check and copy the dependencies script into its own component:

1. make it and check it with:
make all
make check
2. copy the shell script dependencies in your source tree
cp dependencies ~/mysourcetree
3. edit the default dependency file in your source tree (see for instance examples/DEPENDENCIES)
vi ~/mysourcetree/DEPENDENCIES
4. that's it, you can update your DEPENDENCIES files and commit your source tree
