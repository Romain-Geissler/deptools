Some example of dependencies specification.

Each directory contains a DEPENDENCY file.
For extracting the example projects, get into
each directory and run the dependencies script.

For instance:
    $ cd hello-cz
    $ ../../dependencies extract
    Cloning into 'deptools'...
    Cloning into 'hello'...
    HEAD is now at e1bd9c1 Merge commit 'repo.or.cz/mob'
    Cloning into 'yap'...
    HEAD is now at 336cd1e Revert "cmd_unstage: work correctly from a subdirectory

A a real project would copy the dependencies
script along with the DEPENDENCY file, but there we
use the script built by make all.
