Tools such as repo, maven, ant are well\r\nsuited in homogeneous development environment, but are limited to either a\r\nspecific type of repository or not well suited for source dependency\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nRefer to the INSTALL file for installation.\r\n\r\nRefer to the project home page at:\r\nhttp://guillon.github.com/deptools\r\n\r\nRefer to the build status at:\r\nhttps://compilation.ens-lyon.fr/hudson/job/deptools-build\r\n\r\nFill issues and enhancement request at:\r\nhttps://github.com/guillon/deptools/issues\r\n","google":"UA-34812443-1"}
